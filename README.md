# EasyTreasury
EasyTreasury is a project aimed at helping municipalities and companies manage their finances more efficiently and automatically. 
The project begins with a script that initializes a bot using the Puppeteer library to download bank statements and send them to accounting. 
However, the ultimate goal is to build a complete financial management solution that offers features such as accounts payable and receivable control, invoice issuance, financial reporting generation, and integration with other business management tools.  
This repository contains the source code for EasyTreasury, including the initial bot script. 
This is an ever-evolving project, and we are working to make it more complete and robust. Feel free to contribute to the project by sending suggestions, bug reports, or pull requests. 
Together, we can build an efficient and user-friendly financial management solution.
